## Strategy Notes

### Downey - Maximize Conversions (as of Dec 10)
The Downey campaign has gathered enough data for Google's AI to understand what a quality lead looks like. We've upgraded from Maximize Clicks to Maximize Conversions for better lead quality and cost efficiency.

### Van Nuys - Maximize Clicks (Building Data)
Van Nuys remains on Maximize Clicks while we build conversion history. Once we reach 15+ conversions within a 30-day window, we'll make the same upgrade. This is an intentional, data-backed decision - not a performance issue.
